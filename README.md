# dijkstra-java
Implementation of graph using HashMaps and Dijkstra's algorithm in Java.

The algorithm used is inspired by the book "A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms: Level Up Your Core Programming Skills" by Jay Wengrow and Brian MacDonald.

The data used is based on a graph I made based on Valorant's Ascent map. It is made using Microsoft PowerPoint, and yes, the distances were calculated by calculating the line's width/height.

The program will ask you to input two nodes, the first one being the starting node and the last one being the target node. Then, the program will output the shortest distance and the actual route taken, starting from the starting node to the target node.
